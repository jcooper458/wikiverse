wikiverse is a powerful content aggregator. It is mostly built in Javascript, but sits within a Wordpress theme (based on Sage - http://roots.io) and can be installed on any Wordpress installation (please keep in mind the dependencies mentioned underneath).

The core Javascript file responsible for the content aggregation is called wikiverse.js. Feel free to fork it and improve it. 

License information will follow asap. 

# Important:
wikiverse wont work without these two plugins: 

- Edit Author Slug (can be installed via Wordpress - set the slug to "user")
- wp-twitter-api (own plugin - needs configuration via the Wordpress backend)

I added my composer.json to automate the installation of these two plugins. Follow the bedrock / composer instruction to install the plugins. 

For the rest, just install the theme, and start building boards. Enjoy!

Detailed documentation about the Javascript Plugin will follow!
