wikiverse is a powerful content aggregator. Its core functionality is built in Javascript, but sits within a Wordpress theme (based on Sage - http://roots.io) and can be installed on any Wordpress installation (please keep in mind the dependencies mentioned underneath).

The core Javascript file responsible for the content aggregation is called wikiverse.js. Feel free to fork it and improve it. 

License information will follow asap. 

# Important:
wikiverse needs this plugin to work:

- the development beta 2 version of WP-API plugin (will soon be obsolete due to integration in WP core)


I added my composer.json to automate the installation of this plugin. Follow the bedrock / composer instruction to install the plugins. 

For the rest, just install the theme, and start building boards. Enjoy!

Detailed documentation about the Javascript Plugin will follow!

To install the theme, follow Bedrocks's documentation. In a nutshell, the needed steps to get wikiverse up and running on your server can be synthesized as follows: 

1. Install the bedrock Wordpress boilerplate 
2. Replace the composer.json with mine and run 
3. composer update
4. Install the theme-folder found here
6. Configure your twitter oauth credentials under Settings->Twitter API
7. Activate WP-API
