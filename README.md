# Important:
wikiverse wont work without these two plugins: 

- Edit Author Slug (can be installed via Wordpress - set the slug to "user")
- wp-twitter-api (you can find that plugin in my github - needs configuration via the Wordpress backend)

I added my composer.json to automate the installation of these two plugins. Follow the bedrock / composer instruction to install the plugins. 

For the rest, just install the theme, and start building boards. Enjoy!

Detailed documentation about the Javascript Plugin will follow!
